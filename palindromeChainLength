#Palindrome Chain Length 5kyu

# Write a method palindrome_chain_length which takes a positive number and 
# returns the number of special steps needed to obtain a palindrome. 
# The special step is: "reverse the digits, and add to the original number". 
# If the resulting number is not a palindrome, repeat the procedure 
# with the sum until the resulting number is a palindrome.

    count=0
    while str(n) != str(n)[::-1]:
        n=n+int(str(n)[::-1])
        count+=1
    return count
