#The Observed Pin

# When observing the entry of a PIN is possible that each of the digits witnessed could 
# actually be another adjacent digit (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally). 
# E.g. instead of the 1 it could also be the 2 or 4. And instead of the 5 it could also be the 2, 4, 6 or 8.

#Can you find all those variations? It would be nice to have a function, that returns an array of all variations 
# for an observed PIN with a length of 1 to 8 digits. We could name the function getPINs (get_pins in python). 
# But please note that all PINs, the observed one and also the results, must be strings, because of potentially leading '0's.
