#A Chain Adding Function 5kyu

# We want to create a function that will add numbers together 
# when called in succession.
# We also want to be able to continue to add numbers to our chain.
# We should be able to store the result and reuse it.

class add(int):
    def __call__(self, n):
            return add(self+n)
